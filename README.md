# CashGrab---Capstone-Project
Web App for Raspberry Pi Controlled Cash PoS System

The Problem:
  Retail Canadian businesses lose $1.4 Billion in revenue each year due to employee theft. This loss of revenue due to theft is especially prevalent in restaurants, as employees have liberal access to the businessâ€™ cash registers. 
Food contamination is another notable source of revenue loss for restaurants. Restaurants can encounter losses of up to $1.9 Million USD due to a single food contamination outbreak. 
Food contamination is of particular concern for food trucks as the limited number of employees working in the food truck may need to handle the cash register, and food preparation at the same time. 
During busy hours employees may not have the time to properly wash their hands between touching cash and preparing food, leading to food contamination risk.

The Solution:
  CashGrab is an automated point-of-sale device that facilitates cash transactions without the need for employees to directly interact with bank notes. CashGrab allows employees to input transactions, prompt customer payment, and automatically facilitates cash payment, detection, and storage. 
CashGrab also provides an interface for managers to obtain sales and revenue information, and to retrieve stored cash.
